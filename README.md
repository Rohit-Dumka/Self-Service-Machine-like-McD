### Project on Vue.js : Self-Machine-Service
This is a project made with the help of ---

1.HTML </br>
2.CSS </br>
3.JavaScript </br>
4.Vue.js 

With the help of this project one can select anything to buy from the list of 9 items.
You have to  do nothing but just select an item , increase or decrease the quantity 
according to your need and the rest will done by the project itself . 
It will calculate the totall price by itself . Same webpage is used by McDonald's 
sounds cool right ? yes their employees use the same page to calculate the price of customers purchases.
By the way you can use it too ... just a lil bit of editing required . If you are an owner of a shop or you work 
somewhere then this can be very helpfull . 


### What is Vue?

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. 
It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model 
that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex :)
