### H3 What is Vue?

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. 
It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model 
that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex :)
